  I am most intrigued by how personal an artist's work is. My own identity in the forms of memory and family history heavily inspires a lot of my work. Growing up my racial identity was something I had little awareness of, this naivety of the world and coming to terms with my own blackness is extremely important in my work. I am intrigued by finding parallels between my world as a young adult and my world as a child. This connection between past and present is represented in a number of ways, through pictures, familiar textures, color or even through representing issues I am passionate about.

  As my work reflects, I am drawn to a range of materials and processes. I have more recently become inspired by blending <a href="" target="blank">fiber</a> into my work. Color and texture is somewhat inspired by the Ghanaian kente cloth I discovered from close family friends at a young age and the significant role of color in my own home. My work often tests reality in some ways. Through altering photos, challenging the relationship between the foreground and background and using bright intense color. The performance of sewing and gluing string into my pieces, or adding images of a family quilt adds a tangible, real element to my work.

  Color is something I often explore through my work. Bright, warm colors were very apparent in my childhood home. The literal color, as well as the general sense of busyness from the large family environment I grew up with match this overall feeling. This was apparent throughout the entire house, but the transition of color in my childhood bedroom visualized the transition throughout the entire house. My parents had allowed me and my siblings to paint our bedrooms. Over time my bedroom walls changed from a bright mauve purple, to seafoam green before it wasn't really my room or my house anymore, and the walls were painted grey.

  I have experimented with color in several ways. However a more recent exploration of color as a motif, involves using color as a way to hide things. This idea has two origins. Mainly my grandmother's efforts to portray the family in a certain light. It was important to her to have her children always looking nice, and presentable. To put up the illusion of perfection, or that they were withholding a lifestyle they truly couldn't. I draw many parallels between this and my childhood home. The illusion of happiness depicted through color. As things changed overtime, I saw this transition of color, and of feeling.
